This is a first and basic project from odin:
    -This illustrates my basic knowledge of HTML and CSS.
    -The objective of this project is to make a website that "looks" like the google website.

Progress:
    -It was difficult where to start the project, so I started by focusing the center of the website --- they are the google image, search bar, "Google Search", and "I'm feeling Lucky".

    -After that, I focused on the footer and tried to make it look exact as much as possible.

    -The header used most of the codes of the footer, and I just needed to change a few things of the codes.

    -Execept the sign in box and the 9 dots, they need to have a few modifications.
Approximated completion time: 8 hours
